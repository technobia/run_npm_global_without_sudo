# run npm global without sudo

Run these commands to test if you were successful:

Run node -v to see the version of node
```
node -v
```

Run npm -v to see the version of npm
```
npm -v
```

Run npm list -g --depth=0 to see the global npm packages you have installed (should just be npm right now)
```
npm list -g --depth=0
```
